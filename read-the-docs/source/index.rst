Tax-Calculator 
==============

Tax-Calculator simulates the USA federal individual income and payroll
tax system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the USA
population, Tax-Calculator can be used to estimate the aggregate
revenue and distributional effects of tax reforms under static
analysis assumptions.  In conjunction with other modules,
Tax-Calculator can be used to estimate reform effects under a range of
non-static assumptions.  Tax-Calculator is written in Python, an
interpreted language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

This documentation is about **developing** Tax-Calculator.  If you
just want to **use** Tax-Calculator to conduct tax analysis, read this
`user documentation`_.

If you are relying on Tax-Calculator capabilities in your own project,
be sure to read the definition of the `Tax-Calculator Public API`_.
