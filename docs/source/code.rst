Source Code
===========

The Tax Calculator's core capabilities are in the Python package
called taxcalc, the source code for which is located in the
tax-calculator/taxcalc directory.

Here we provide a high-level view of the taxcalc package that provides
links to the source code.  This high-level view is organized around
the modules that compose the taxcalc package.  Below is a full list
of the taxcalc package modules (in alphabetical order) with
documentation about how to call each member of the module.  There is
also a link to the complete source code for each member in the list.

It may be more convenient to access this list interactively via the
alphabetical :ref:`genindex` of taxcalc modules and module members or
the alphabetical :ref:`modindex`.

The complete list is below.
