==========

The Tax-Calculator is currently under development. Users should be
forewarned that the API could change significantly. Additionally, the
implementation is subject to wild change. Therefore, there is NO
GUARANTEE OF ACCURACY. THE CODE SHOULD NOT CURRENTLY BE USED FOR
PUBLICATIONS, JOURNAL ARTICLES, OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. Essentially, you
should assume the calculations are unreliable until we finish the code
re-architecture and have checked the results against other existing
implementations of the tax code. The package will have released
versions, which will be checked against existing code prior to
release. Stay tuned for an upcoming release!
