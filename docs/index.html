<h1 id="top">Using Tax-Calculator</h1>

<p>This document tells you how to use Tax-Calculator, an open-source
federal income and payroll tax simulation model.  The two ways of
using Tax-Calculator described here require no computer programming.
If you are interested in Python programming with Tax-Calculator, you
should read the tested recipes in our
<a href="http://open-source-economics.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html">
Tax-Calculator Cookbook</a>. If you want to participate in the
development of Tax-Calculator &mdash; by asking a question, reporting
a bug, improving the documentation or making an enhancement to the
Python source code &mdash; you should go to
the <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator">
developer website</a>.</p>

<p>Please cite the source of your analysis as <q>Tax-Calculator
release #.#.#, author's calculations.</q> If you wish to link to
Tax-Calculator, this page is preferred.  Additionally, we strongly
recommend that you describe the input data used, and provide a link to
the materials required to replicate your analysis or, at least, note
that those materials are available upon request.</p>

<h2 id="gui">TaxBrain GUI</h2>

<p>You can use Tax-Calculator via a graphical user interface (GUI)
provided by the <a href="http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/">TaxBrain web
application</a>.  This approach requires only an Internet connection
and web browser on your computer.  TaxBrain (TB) uses a micro dataset
to produce both aggregate and distributional reform estimates for each
of ten years for a tax reform you specify.  The calculations take just
a couple of minutes and there is flexibility to show different kinds
of distributional results as well as aggregate revenue results.</p>

<p><a href="#gui-init-dynamic">Initiate Dynamic Analysis</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-spec-reform">Specify Tax Reform</h3>

<p>The first step in using TaxBrain is to set the Start Year for the
tax calculations.  Then specify the values of policy parameters that
you want to change in your reform.</p>

<p>By default the policy parameter boxes contain Start Year values.
Simply replace the current-law value with the Start Year reform value.
If some or all of your reform provisions are going to begin after the
Start Year, simply fill in the pre-reform years with asterisks.  So,
for example, if Start Year is 2017 and your reform calls for raising
the social security payroll tax rate to 13 percent in 2018 and then
to 14 percent in 2020, you would enter in that box the following:
<pre>*,0.13,*,0.14</pre>
This parameter is not indexed, so the 0.13 value for 2018 will be
extrapolated to 2019, and the 0.14 value for 2020 will be in force
in all subsequent years.</p>

<p><a href="#gui">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-init-static">Initiate Static Analysis</h3>

<p>Simply click on the Show me the results! button to start the tax
calculations.  That button will use the full sample and take a couple
of minutes to compute revenue and distributional results for each of
ten years beginning with the Start Year you specified.</p>

<p>There is also a Quick Calculation! button that produces results
only for the Start Year using a sub-sample of the full sample.</p>

<p><a href="#gui">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-view-static">View/Download Static Results</h3>

<p>After the tax calculations are completed, you are shown a results
page that presents various options: you can specify, view and download
a total liabilities table, your can specify, view and download a
distribution table, you can use your reform to conduct different types
of dynamic analysis (via the button labeled Link to Dynamic
Simulations), and finally, you can go back to the policy parameters
page to modify your reform (via the button labeled Edit Parameters).</p>

<p>There are three variants of the <b>total liabilities table</b>.
The variant shown initially is Change, meaning the amounts are the
difference between liabilities under your reform and the liabilities
projected for current-law policy.  You can also elect to see the
reform and current-law levels.</p>

<p>There are many variants of the <b>distribution table</b>.  Try
clicking on the options to the left to define the nature of the table
and the year for which it is constructed.  Try clicking on the options
to the right to specify which columns are included in the table.  An
easy way to uncheck all the column boxes is to double click on the
Select All box.</p>

<p>There are three download options for each of these two tables:</p>

<p><b>Print</b> creates a new page in your browser that is suitable
for printing.</p>

<p><b>Copy</b> puts the table on the clipboard of your local computer
so that you can paste it anywhere on your computer.  The copy on the
clipboard uses invisible tab characters to separate the table's
columns.</p>

<p><b>CSV</b> downloads to your computer a CSV-formatted file
containing the information in the table.  CSV-formatted files can be
easily imported into any spreadsheet program.</p>

<p><a href="#gui">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="gui-init-dynamic">Initiate Dynamic Analysis</h3>

<p>After clicking on the Link to Dynamic Simulations on the static
results page, you are presented with a page that allows you to choose
three different types of dynamic simulations to conduct on your tax
reform:</p>

<p><b>Partial Equilibrium Simulation</b> is described this way:
<i>This approach answers the question, <q>how would taxpayer behavior
(income and deductions) affect revenue if all other prices in the
economy could stay the same?</q></i></p>

<p><b>Overlapping Generations Simulation</b> is described this way:
<i>This approach answers the question, <q>how does tax policy affect
macroeconomic aggregates and prices?</q></i></p>

<p><b>Macro Elasticity Simulation</b> is described this way:
<i>This approach harnesses econometric estimates of the historical
relationship between tax policy and the macro economy to predict the
effect of tax reforms on economic growth.</i></p>

Clicking on one of these choices will allow you to specify some
additional economic assumption parameters and initiate the dynamic
analysis using your economic assumptions.

<a href="#doc">Back to Document Contents</a></p>


<h2 id="cli">tc CLI</h2>

<p>You can use Tax-Calculator on your own computer via a command line
interface (CLI) called tc.  This approach requires the installation of
Anaconda Python and the taxcalc package on your computer as well as
the use of a text editor to prepare simple files that are read by tc.
Computer programming knowledge is not required, but if you are
prevented from doing the easy installation or you are not willing to
work at the command line (Terminal on Mac or Command Prompt on
Windows) and use an editor (for example, TextEdit on Mac or Notepad on
Windows), then you should probably use the TaxBrain GUI.</p>

<p>If you are comfortable using an editor to prepare text files that
describe your tax reforms, but don't want to install Python and tc on
your computer, you can upload reform files to TaxBrain where all the
analysis is conducted (as described in the previous section).  If you
are interested in this file-upload approach, skip the first part of
this section, read the next part on how to specify policy reform
files, and then skip to the last part of this section on how to upload
files to TaxBrain.</p>

<h3 id="cli-install-test">Install/Test tc CLI</h3>

<p>Installation of tc CLI involves several steps:</p>

<p><b>Install the free Anaconda Python distribution</b> by going to
the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">Continuum Analytics
download page</a> and selecting a version of Python.  You should install
Python 3.6 because we will be forced to discontinue support for Python
2.7 at the end of 2018.  You must do this installation even if you already
have Python installed on your computer because the Anaconda
distribution contains all the additional Python packages that
Tax-Calculator uses to conduct tax calculations (many of which are not
included in other Python installations). You can install the Anaconda
distribution without having administrative privileges on your computer
and the Anaconda distribution will not interfere with any Python
installation that came as part of your computer’s operating
system.</p>

<p><b>Check your Anaconda Python installation</b> by entering the
following two commands at the operating system command prompt (which
is shown as <kbd>$</kbd> here, but would be <kbd>></kbd> on Windows)
in any directory:
<pre>$ conda --version</pre>
Expected output is something like <kbd>conda 4.4.7</kbd>
<pre>$ python --version</pre>
Expected output should contain the <kbd>Python 3.6</kbd> phrase as
well as the <kbd>Anaconda</kbd> phrase, the presence of which confirm
that the installation went smoothly.</p>

<p><b>Install the free taxcalc package</b> by entering the following:
<pre>$ conda install -c ospc taxcalc</pre>
Expected output should contain information about all the additional
packages that Tax-Calculator needs.  After all that information has
been shown on the screen, press the <kbd>y</kbd> key to proceed with
the package installation.</p>

<p><b>Check your installation of tc</b> (the CLI to Tax-Calculator) by
entering the following:
<pre>$ tc --test</pre>
Expected output (after about twenty seconds) is <kbd>PASSED
TEST</kbd>.  If you get <kbd>FAILED TEST</kbd>, something went wrong
in the installation process.  If the installation test fails, please
report your experience by creating a new issue at
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/issues">
this website</a> or by sending an email to one of the core maintainers
of Tax-Calculator listed at the bottom of the <i>What is TaxBrain?</i>
page at <a href="http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/">this website</a>.

<p>If your installation passes the test, you are ready to begin using
tc to analyze your tax reforms.  Continue reading this section for
information about how to do that.  But if you want a quick hint about
the range of tc capabilities, enter the following:
<pre>$ tc --help</pre>
</p>

<p>After you have installed the taxcalc package, keep it up to date by
checking for new releases at
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/RELEASES.md#tax-calculator-release-history">this page</a> and, when there
is a new release, executing this command:
<pre>$ conda update -c ospc taxcalc</pre>
The packages are usually available about an hour after the release.</p>

<p>The basic idea of tc tax analysis is that each tax reform is
specified in a text file using a simple method to describe the details
of the reform.  Read the next part of this section to see how policy
reform files are formatted.</p>

<p><a href="#cli">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="cli-spec-reform">Specify Tax Reform</h3>

<p>The details of a tax reform are contained in a text file that you
write with a text editor.  The reform is expressed by specifying which
tax policy parameters are changed from their current-law values by the
reform.  The timing and magnitude of these policy parameter changes
are written in JSON, a simple and widely-used data-specification
language.</p>

<p>For several examples of reform files and the general rules for
writing JSON reform files, go
to <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/reforms/REFORMS.md">this
page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to upload a reform file to TaxBrain for static analysis
(rather than use the tc CLI on your computer for analysis), go to this
section's <a href="#cli-taxbrain-upload">last part</a>, which
discusses uploading files to TaxBrain.  If you want to assume any
responses to your tax reform (that is, if you want to conduct
non-static analysis), read the next part before going to the last
part.</p>

<p><a href="#cli">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="cli-spec-assump">Specify Analysis Assumptions</h3>

<p>This part explains how to specify economic assumption files used in
non-static tax analysis.  If you want to start out doing static
analysis, you can skip this part now and come back to read it whenever
you want to go beyond static analysis.
The <a href="#cli-spec-funits">next part</a> of this section discusses
filing-unit input files.</p>

<p>The details of economic assumptions are contained in a
text file that you write with a text editor.  The assumptions are
expressed by specifying which parameters are changed from
their default values, all of which are zero.  The timing and magnitude of
these parameter changes are written in JSON, a simple and
widely-used data-specification language.</p>

<p>For examples of economic assumption files and the general rules for
writing JSON assumption files, go
to <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/assumptions/ASSUMPTIONS.md">this
page</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to upload policy reform and economic assumption files
to TaxBrain, you can go directly to this
section's <a href="#cli-taxbrain-upload">last part</a>, which
discusses uploading files to TaxBrain.  If you want to analyze your
tax reforms on your own computer, go to the next part on how to
specify tax filing units used in the analysis.</p>

<p><a href="#cli">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="cli-spec-funits">Specify Filing Units</h3>

<p>The taxcalc package containing the tc CLI to Tax-Calculator does
not include the microsimulation sample used by TaxBrain.  This is
because, unlike Census survey public-use files, the IRS-SOI Public Use
File (PUF) is proprietary.  If you or your organization has paid IRS
to use the PUF version being used by TaxBrain, then it may be possible
for us to share with you our TaxBrain sample, which we
call <kbd>puf.csv</kbd> even though it contains CPS records that
represent non-filers.  Otherwise, you have three choices.</p>

<p><b>First</b>, you can easily create with an editor a CSV-formatted
file containing several filing units whose experience under your tax
reform is of interest to you.  Much of the public discussion of tax
reforms is of this type: how is this family or that family affected by
a reform; how do they fare under different reforms; etc.  Notice that
this kind of analysis of a few exemplary families is something you
cannot do on TaxBrain.  The test conducted to check the tc
installation has left one such file.  It is called <kbd>test.csv</kbd>
and contains two filing units with only wage and salary income: a
lower income family and a higher income family.  You can use the
<kbd>test.csv</kbd> file as tc input to analyze your tax reforms.
Before creating your own input files be sure to read the short set of
guidelines that appear after this list of three choices.</p>

<p><b>Second</b>, recently we made freely
available a public-use file containing only filing units derived from
several recent March CPS surveys.  For several reasons, the results generated
by this <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file are substantially different from the results
generated by the <kbd>puf.csv</kbd> file.  The <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file
contains a sample of the population while the <kbd>puf.csv</kbd> file
contains mostly a sample of income tax filers in which high-income
filing units are over represented.  Also, the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file
has many income variables that are missing (and assumed to be zero by
Tax-Calculator), which causes an understating of total incomes,
especially for those with high incomes.  All these differences
mean that the aggregate revenue and distributional results generated
when using the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file as input to Tax-Calculator can
be substantially different from the results generated when using the
<kbd>puf.csv</kbd> file as input.  And this is particularly true when
analyzing reforms that change the tax treatment of high-income filers.</p>

<p><b>Third</b>, when you want to estimate how your reform affects
total tax liabilities and/or the distribution of tax liabilities, you
can always upload your policy reform and economic assumption files
to TaxBrain.  Combining this option with the first option provides a
complete tax analysis capability.
The <a href="#cli-taxbrain-upload">last part</a> of this section
describes how to upload files to TaxBrain.</p>

<p><b>Input-File-Preparation Guidelines</b></p>

<p>The tc CLI to Tax-Calculator is flexible enough to read almost any
kind of CSV-formatted input data on filing units as long as the
variable names correspond to those expected by Tax-Calculator.  The
only required input variables are <kbd>RECID</kbd> (a unique
filing-unit record identifier) and <kbd>MARS</kbd> (a positive-valued
filing-status indicator).  Other variables in the input file must have
variable names that are listed in the <a href="#input">Input
Variables</a> section for them to affect the tax calculations.  Any
variable listed in Input Variables that is not in an input file is
automatically set to zero for every filing unit.  Variables
in the input file that are not listed in Input Variables are ignored
by Tax-Calculator.</p>

<p>However, there are important data-preparation issues related to the
fact that the payroll tax is a tax on individuals, not on income-tax
filing units.  Tax-Calculator expects that the filing-unit total for
each of several earnings-related variables is split between the
taxpayer and the spouse.  It is the responsibility of anyone preparing
data for Tax-Calculator input to do this earnings splitting.  Here are
the relationships between the filing-unit variable and the taxpayer
(<kbd>p</kbd>) and spouse (<kbd>s</kbd>) variables expected by
Tax-Calculator:
<pre>
e00200 = e00200p + e00200s
e00900 = e00900p + e00900s
e02100 = e02100p + e02100s
</pre>
Obviously, when <kbd>MARS</kbd> is not equal to 2 (married filing
jointly), the values of the three <kbd>s</kbd> variables are zero and
the value of each <kbd>p</kbd> variable is equal to the value of its
corresponding filing-unit variable.  Note that the input file can
omit any one, or all, of these three sets variables.  If the three
variables in one of these sets are omitted, the required relationship
will be satisfied because zero equals zero plus zero.</p>

<p>But when including one of these three sets of variables, it is up
to you to specify the taxpayer-spouse split.  You will get an error
message from Tax-Calculator, and it will stop running, if you do not
split the filing-unit amount between taxpayer and spouse so that the
above equations hold for each filing unit in the input file.</p>

<p>In addition to this earnings-splitting data-preparation issue,
Tax-Calculator expects that the value of ordinary dividends
(<kbd>e00600</kbd>) will be no less than the value of qualified
dividends (<kbd>e00650</kbd>) for each filing unit.  And it also
expects that the value of total pension and annuity income
(<kbd>e01500</kbd>) will be no less than the value of taxable pension
and annuity income (<kbd>e01700</kbd>) for each filing unit.  Again,
it is your responsibility to prepare input data in a way that ensures
these relationships are true for each filing unit.</p>

<p id="marskids">Here's an example of how to specify a few stylized
filing units with and without young children.
<pre>
RECID,MARS,XTOT,EIC,n24,...
   11,   1,   1,  0,  0, ... <== single person with no kids
   12,   4,   2,  1,  1, ... <== single person with a young kid
   13,   2,   4,  2,  2, ... <== married couple with two young kids
</pre>
Be sure to read the documentation of the <kbd>MARS</kbd>, <kbd>XTOT</kbd>,
<kbd>EIC</kbd>, and <kbd>n24</kbd> input variables.  Also, there may
be a need to add of child-age input variables if you want to simulate
reforms like a child credit bonus for children under five years of
age.  Also, the universal basic income (UBI) reform is implemented
using its own set of three age-count input variables.

<p><a href="#cli">Back to Section Contents</a></p>


<h3 id="cli-init-analysis">Initiate Reform Analysis</h3>

<p>The tc CLI to Tax-Calculator requires only an input file containing
one or more filing units.  A baseline file is optional; no baseline
file implies the policy baseline is current-law policy.  A policy
reform file is optional; no reform file implies no reform (that is,
you want to analyze current-law policy).  An economic assumption file
is also optional; no assumption file implies you want to conduct
static analysis.  The output files written by tc are built-up from
the name of the input file, baseline file, reform file, and
assumption file using a <kbd>#</kbd> character if the option is
not specified.</p>

<p>Here we explain how to conduct tax analysis with the tc CLI by
presenting a series of examples and explaining what output is produced
in each example.  There are several types of output that tc can
generate so there will be more than a few examples.  The examples are
numbered in order to make it easier to refer to different examples.
All the examples assume that the input file is <kbd>test.csv</kbd>,
which was mentioned in previous part of this section.</p>

<p><pre>
(1)$ tc test.csv 2020
</pre></p>

<p>Example (1) produces a minimal output file containing 2020 tax
liabilities for each filing unit assuming the income amounts in the
input file are amounts for 2020 and assuming current-law tax policy
projected to 2020.  The name of the CSV-formatted output file is
<kbd>test-20-#-#-#.csv</kbd>.  The first <kbd>#</kbd> symbol indicates
we did not specify a baseline file and the second <kbd>#</kbd> symbol
indicates we did not specify a policy reform file and the
third <kbd>#</kbd> symbol indicates we did not specify an economic
assumption file.
The variables included in the minimal output file include:
<kbd>RECID</kbd> (of filing unit in the input file),
<kbd>YEAR</kbd> (specified when executing tc CLI),
<kbd>WEIGHT</kbd> (which is same as <kbd>s006</kbd>),
<kbd>INCTAX</kbd> (which is same as <kbd>iitax</kbd>),
<kbd>LSTAX</kbd> (which is same as <kbd>lumpsum_tax</kbd>) and
<kbd>PAYTAX</kbd> (which is same as <kbd>payroll_tax</kbd>).
</p>

<p>Also, documentation of the reform is always written to a text file
ending in <kbd>-doc.text</kbd>, which in this example would be
named <kbd>test-20-#-#-#-doc.text</kbd>.</p>

<p><pre>
(2)$ tc test.csv 2020 --dump
</pre></p>

<p>Example (2) produces a much more complete output file with the same
name <kbd>test-20-#-#-#.csv</kbd> as the minimal output file produced in
example (1).  No other output is generated other than the
<kbd>test-20-#-#-#-doc.text</kbd> file.   The
<kbd>--dump</kbd> option causes <b>all</b> the input variables (including
the ones understood by Tax-Calculator but not included
in <kbd>test.csv</kbd>, which are all zero) and <b>all</b> the output
variables calculated by Tax-Calculator to be included in the output
file.  For a complete list of input variables, see
the <a href="#input">Input Variables</a> section.  For a complete list
of output variables, see the <a href="#output">Output Variables</a>
section.  Since Tax-Calculator ignores variables in the input file
that are not in the Input Variables section, the dump output file in
example (2) can be used as an input file and it will produce exactly
the same tax liabilities (apart from rounding errors of one or two
cents) as in the original dump output.</p>

<p id="partdump">This full dump output can be useful for debugging and
is small when using just a few filing units as input.  But
when using large samples as input (for example, the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd>
input file), the size of the dump output becomes quite large. For
Tax-Calculator versions 0.15.0 and higher, there is a way to specify
a <b>partial dump</b> that includes only variables of interest.  To
have <kbd>tc</kbd> do a partial dump, create a text file that lists
the names of the variables to be included in the partial dump.  You
can put the varible names on separate lines and/or put several names
on one line separated by spaces.  Then point to that file using the
<kbd>--dvars</kbd> option.  So, for example, if your list of dump
variables is in a file named <kbd>mydumpvars</kbd>, a partial dump
file is created this way:
<pre>
$ tc cps.csv 2020 --dump --dvars mydumpvars
</pre>
If there is no <kbd>--dvars</kbd> option, the <kbd>--dump</kbd> option
produces a full dump.</p>

<p><pre>
(3)$ tc test.csv 2020 --sqldb
</pre></p>

<p>Example (3) produces the same dump output as example (2) except
that the dump output is written not to a CSV-formatted file, but to
the dump table in an SQLite3 database file, which is
called <kbd>test-20-#-#-#.db</kbd> in this example.  Because
the <kbd>--dump</kbd> option is not used in example (3), minimal
output will be written to the <kbd>test-20-#-#-#.csv</kbd> file.
Note that use of the <kbd>--dvars</kbd> option causes
the contents of the database file to be a partial dump.</p>

<p> Pros and cons of putting dump output in a CSV file or an SQLite3
database table:  The CSV file is almost twice as large as the
database, but it can be easily imported into a wide range of
statistical packages.  The main advantage of the
SQLite3 database is that the Anaconda Python distribution includes
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cli.html">sqlite3</a> (or sqlite3.exe
on Windows), a command-line tool that can be used to tabulate dump
output using structured query language (SQL).  SQL is a language that
you use to specify the tabulation you want and the SQL database
figures out the procedure for generating your tabulation and then
executes that procedure; there is no computer programming involved.
We will give an example of SQL tabulation of dump output in the next
part of this section.</p>

<p><pre>
(4)$ tc test.csv 2020 --dump --sqldb
</pre></p>

<p>Example (4) shows that you can get dump output in the two different
formats from a single tc run.</p>

<p>The remaining examples use neither the <kbd>--dump</kbd> nor the
<kbd>--sqldb</kbd> option, and thus, produce minimal output for the
reform.  But either or both of those options could be used in all the
subsequent examples to generate more complete output for the reform.</p>

<p><pre>
(5)$ tc test.csv 2021 --reform ref3.json
</pre></p>

<p>Example (5) produces 2021 output for the filing units in the 
<kbd>test.csv</kbd> file using the policy reform specified in
the <kbd>ref3.json</kbd> file.  Because no <kbd>--assump</kbd>
option is used, the output results are produced using static analysis.
The name of the output file in this example is
<kbd>test-21-#-ref3-#.csv</kbd>.</p>

<p id="compoundreform">If, in addition to <kbd>ref3.json</kbd>, there
was a <kbd>ref4.json</kbd> reform file and analysis of the <b>compound
reform</b> (consisting of first implementing the <kbd>ref3.json</kbd>
reform relative to current-law policy and then implementing
the <kbd>ref4.json</kbd> reform relative to the <kbd>ref3.json</kbd>
reform) is desired, both reform files can be mentioned in
the tc <kbd>--reform</kbd> option as follows:
<pre>
$ tc test.csv 2021 --reform ref3.json+ref4.json
</pre>
The above command generates an output file named
<kbd>test-21-#-ref3+ref4-#.csv</kbd></p>

<p><pre>
(6)$ tc test.csv 2021 --reform ref3.json --assump res1.json
</pre></p>

<p>Example (6) produces 2021 output for the filing units in the 
<kbd>test.csv</kbd> file using the policy reform specified in
the <kbd>ref3.json</kbd> file and the economic assumptions
specified in the <kbd>res1.json</kbd> file.  The output results
produced by this non-static analysis are written to the 
<kbd>test-21-#-ref3-res1.csv</kbd> file.</p>

<p id="outdir">In the preceding examples, all the output files are
written in the directory where the tc command was executed.  If you
want the output files to be written in a different directory, use
the <kbd>--outdir</kbd> option.  So, for example, you have created
the <kbd>myoutput</kbd> directory as directory at the same level as
the directory from where you are running tc, output files will be
written there if you use the <kbd>--outdir myoutput</kbd> option.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate output options that work only if
each filing unit in the input file has a positive sampling weight
(<kbd>s006</kbd>).  So, we are going to use the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd>
file in these examples along with the policy reform specified in
the <kbd>ref3.json</kbd> file, the content of which is:
<pre>
// ref3.json raises personal exemption amount to 8000 in 2022,
// after which it continues to be indexed to price inflation.
{
    "policy": {
        "_II_em": {"2022": [8000]}
    }
}
</pre></p>

<p>The output options illustrated in the following examples generate
tables of the post-reform level and the reform-induced change in tax
liability by income deciles as well as graphs of marginal and average
tax rates and percentage change in aftertax income by income percentiles.
These tables and graphs are meant to provide
a quick glance at the impact of a reform.  Any serious analysis of a
reform will involve generating custom tables and graphs using
<a href="#partdump">partial dump</a> output.  One of many examples
of this sort of custom analysis is
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/tax-bill-calculator/?">here</a>.</p>

<p>Example (7) produces 2022 static output for the filing units in the
<kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file using the policy reform specified in
the <kbd>ref3.json</kbd> file.  Notice that Tax-Calculator knows to
extrapolate (or <q>age</q>) filing unit data in the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd>
file to the specified tax year.  It knows to do that because of the
special input file name <kbd>cps.csv</kbd>.  The tables produced by
this static analysis are written to the
<kbd>cps-22-#-ref3-#-tab.text</kbd> file.  Note that on Windows
you would use <kbd>dir</kbd> instead of <kbd>ls</kbd> and 
<kbd>type</kbd> instead of <kbd>cat</kbd>.</p>

<p>Also note that the tables above in example (7) include in the bottom
decile some filing units who have negative or zero expanded income in
the baseline.  If you want tables that somehow exclude those filing
units, use the <kbd>--dump</kbd> option and tabulate your own tables.

</pre></p>

<p>Example (8) is like example (7) except we ask for 2024 static
output and for graphs instead of tables, although we could ask for
both.  The HTML files containing the graphs can be viewed in your
browser.</p>

<p>Here is what the average tax rate graph

<p>Here is what the percentage change in aftertax income graph
in <kbd>cps-24-#-ref3-#-pch.html</kbd> looks like:</p>

<p><img src="pch.png" alt="pch graph"></p>

<p>There is yet another tc CLI output option that writes to the screen
results from a normative welfare analysis of the specified policy
reform.  This <kbd>--ceeu</kbd> option produces experimental results
that make sense only with input files that contain representative
samples of the population such as the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file.  The
name of this option stands for certainty-equivalent expected utility.
If you want to use this output option, you should read the commented
Python source code for the <kbd>ce_aftertax_expanded_income</kbd>
function in the <kbd>taxcalc/utils.py</kbd> file at the
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator">
developer website</a>.</p>

<p id="baseline">None of the above examples use the
<kbd>--baseline</kbd> option, which means that baseline policy in
those examples is current-law policy.  The following example shows how
to use the <kbd>--baseline</kbd> option to engage in counter-factual
historical analysis.  Suppose we want to analyze what would have
happened if some alternative to TCJA had been enacted in late 2017.
To do this we need to have pre-TCJA policy be the baseline policy and
we need to have the alternative reform be implemented relative to
pre-TCJA policy.  The following tc run does exactly that using a local
copy of
the <a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/reforms/2017_law.json">2017_law.json<a>
file and the <kbd>alt_reform.json</kbd> file containing the
alternative reform defined relative to pre-TCJA law.</p>

</pre></p>

<p id="fastexec">In all the examples in this section, we have executed
one tc run at at time.  But <b>what if you want to execute many tc
runs</b> because you want results for many years and/or for several
different reforms.  Unless you are asking for full-dump output, a
single tc run should take no more than one minute on your computer
(even if you are using the large <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> input file).  The
easiest way to speed up the execution of many tc runs is to split them
into groups of runs and execute each group of runs in a different
command-prompt window.  On most modern computers that have four CPU
cores and a fast disk drive, executing four runs in different windows
will take not much more time than executing a single tc run.  If you
have more than one run in each group, put them in a Unix/Mac bash
script or a Windows batch file, and execute one script in each
command-prompt window.  If it still takes too long, consider splitting
the tc runs across more than one computer.</p>

<h3 id="cli-tab-results">Tabulate Reform Results</h3>

<p>Given that tc CLI output can be written to either CSV-formatted
files or SQLite3 database files, there is an enormous range of
software tools that can be used to tabulate the output.  You can use
SAS or R, Stata or MATLAB, or even import output into a spreadsheet
(but this would seem to be the least useful option).  If you just
want to compare the contents of two output files, you can use your
favorite graphical diff program to view the two files <q>side by side</q>
with highlighting of numbers that are different.  The main point
is to use a software tool that is available to you and that you have
experience using.</p>

<p>Here we give some examples of using the <kbd>sqlite3</kbd>
command-line tool that is part of the Anaconda distribution (so it is
always available when using Tax-Calculator).  The first step, of
course, is to use the <kbd>--sqldb</kbd> option when running tc.  Then
you can use the <kbd>sqlite3</kbd> tool interactively or use it to
execute SQL scripts you have saved in a text file.  We'll provide
examples of both those approaches.  There are many online tutorials on
the SQL select command; if you want to learn more, search the
Internet.</p>

<p>First, we provide a simple example of using <kbd>sqlite3</kbd>
interactively.  This approach is ideal for exploratory data analysis.
Our example uses the <kbd>cps.csv</kbd> file as input, but you can do
the following with the output from any input file that has weights
(<kbd>s006</kbd>).  Also, we specify no policy reform file, so the
output is for current-law policy.  What you cannot see from the
following record of the analysis is that the <kbd>sqlite3</kbd> tool
keeps a command history, so pressing the up-arrow key will bring up
the prior command for editing.  This feature reduces substantially the
amount of typing required to conduct exploratory data analysis.
<pre>

</pre>
</p>

<p>Second, we provide a simple example of using <kbd>sqlite3</kbd>
with SQL commands stored in a text file.  This approach is useful
if you want to tabulate many different output files in the same way.
This second example assumes that the first example has already
been done.  Note that on Windows you should replace <kbd>cat</kbd>
with <kbd>type</kbd>.

The <kbd>cat</kbd> command writes the contents of
the <kbd>tab.sql</kbd> file to stdout.  We do nothing but that in the
first command in order to show you the file contents.  The second
command pipes the contents of the <kbd>tab.sql</kbd> file into
the <kbd>sqlite3</kbd> tool, which executes the SQL statements and
writes the tabulation results to stdout.  (If you're wondering about
the validity of those high marginal tax rates, rest assured that all
filing units with marginal income tax rates greater than sixty
percent have been checked by hand and are valid: most are
caught in the rapid phase-out of non-refundable education credits
or in the phase-in of taxation of social security benefits.
The negative marginal tax rates are caused by refundable credits,
primarily the earned income tax credit.)</p>

<p>If you want to use the <kbd>sqlite3</kbd> tool to tabulate the
changes caused by a reform, use the tc CLI to generate two database
dump files (one for current-law policy and the other for your reform)
and then use the SQLite3 ATTACH command to make both database files
available in your SQLite tabulation session.</p>


<h3 id="cli-taxbrain-upload">Upload Files to TaxBrain</h3>

<p>Any policy reform or economic assumption files you can use with tc
can be uploaded to trigger a TaxBrain run.  As mentioned above the
main advantages of doing this is getting access to the proprietary
<kbd>puf.csv</kbd> input file, getting fast execution of both reform
and current-law policy runs for ten years and getting the flexibility
to specify a variety of distributional tables.  All the TaxBrain results
can be downloaded to your computer for storage or for additional
analysis.</p>

<p>The files on your computer can be uploaded
at <a href="http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/">the TaxBrain
file-upload page</a>.</p>

<p>An extended example of how preliminary tax analysis on your
computer can be combined with TaxBrain file-uploading is

<h2 id="params">Assumption Parameters</h2>

<p>This section contains documentation of several sets of parameters
that characterize responses to a tax reform.  Consumption
parameters are used to compute marginal tax rates and to compute the
consumption value of in-kind benefits.  Behavior
parameters are used to compute changes in input variables caused by a
tax reform in a partial-equilibrium setting.  Growdiff parameters are
used to specify baseline differences and/or reform responses in the
annual rate of growth in economic variables.</p>

<p>All the assumption parameters can be used by the tc CLI, but only
those with a <i>TB Name</i> appear in the TaxBrain GUI.  All these
assumption parameters control advanced features of Tax-Calculator, so
understanding the
<a href="https://github.com/open-source-economics/Tax-Calculator/tree/master/taxcalc">source
code</a> that uses them is essential.  Default values of most
assumption parameters are zero and are projected into the future at
that value, which implies no response to the reform.  Using the
default no-reform-response assumption for all the response parameters
generates a static analysis of the tax reform.  The benefit value 
consumption parameters have a default value of one, which implies the
consumption value of the in-kind benefits is equal to the government
cost of providing the benefits.</p>
