Python interface
================

Of the two ways of using Tax-Calculator described in this guide, one
requires writing Python programs, the other involves using a
command-line tool and requires no computer programming. The detailed
information in this guide about policy parameters, input variables,
output variables, and assumption parameters, will be useful to you
either way you use Tax-Calculator.

If you want to learn more about how to write Python programs that use
Tax-Calculator, follow the {doc}`../../recipes/index`, which contains
a collection of tested recipes that employ both basic and advanced
techniques.
