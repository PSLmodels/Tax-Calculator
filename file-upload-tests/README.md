Cross-Checking Reform Results from Tax-Calculator and TaxBrain File-Upload
==========================================================================

The contents of this file-uploads-tests directory are for use by the
core development team only.  The purpose of the cross-checking is to
test that Tax-Calculator produces essentially the same reform results
when accessed in two different ways: (1) via the TaxBrain file-upload
web page <http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/> and (2) via the taxcalc
package running on a local computer.

The contents of this directory include JSON reform and assumption
files used in the cross-checking.  The method and results of the
cross-checking are shown at the top of each JSON file in this
directory.
