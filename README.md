Tax Calculator
==============

The Tax Calculator simulates the US federal individual income tax
system.  In conjunction with micro data that represent the US
population and a set of behavioral assumptions, the Tax Calculator can
be used to conduct revenue scoring and distributional analyses of tax
policies.  The Tax Calculator is written in Python, an interpreted
language that can execute on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
