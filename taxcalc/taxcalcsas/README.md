Comparison of Tax-Calculator and NBER taxcalc.sas results
=========================================================

This directory includes tools used to compare the income tax results
generated by Tax-Calculator with results generated by a [SAS
program](http://www.nber.org/taxcalc) developed by Dan Feenberg and
Ina Shapiro of NBER.

The tools included in this directory support the following
cross-model-comparison work flow:

  1. Generate a sample of tax filing units (INPUT).
  2. Generate OUTPUT from INPUT using the inctax.py script.
  3. Generate OUTPUT from INPUT using the NBER taxcalc.sas program.
  4. Generate tax differences by comparing the two OUTPUT files.


First comparison: methods and results
-------------------------------------

(1) The INPUT file used in the first comparison is generated as
follows:

```
$ cd taxcalc/taxcalcsas
```

```
$ tclsh ../validation/make-in.tcl 2013 c > c13.in
```

The ```c13.in``` file is in Internet-TAXSIM format, so we
convert that file to CSV format as follows:

```
$ python ../../simtax.py --taxsim2441 --records c13.in
```

We rename the file generated by the ```--records``` option, as follows:

 ```
$ mv c13.in.records c13.csv
```

We process the renamed INPUT file with the ```inctax.py``` command-line
interface to Tax-Calculator as follows:

```
$ python ../../inctax.py c13.csv 2013
```

The resulting OUTPUT file is identical to that produced by the
```simtax.py``` command-line interface to Tax-Calculator as shown
below:

```
$ diff c13-13.out-inctax c13.in.out-simtax
```

```
$
```

So, the contents of the ```c13.in``` and ```c13.csv``` files are identical
in the sense that they generate the exact same Tax-Calculator OUTPUT files:
```c13.in.out-simtax```, which is generated by the ```simtax.py```
command-line interface to the Tax-Calculator using ```c13.in``` as
INPUT, and ```c13-13.out-inctax```, which is generated by the
```inctax.py``` command-line interface to the Tax-Calculator using
```c13.csv``` as INPUT.

(2) The Tax-Calculator OUTPUT file is the ```c13-13.out-inctax``` file.

(3) The taxcalc.sas OUTPUT file, which is called c13.out-sas, has been
generated by taxcalc.sas using the ```c13.csv``` file as input.

(4) The comparison of the two OUTPUT files is accomplished as follows:

```
$ cp c13-13.out-inctax py-out
```

After shortening the Tax-Calculator OUTPUT file name, we convert the
taxcalc.sas OUTPUT file from CSV format to Internet-TAXSIM output format
as follows:

```
$ python sas2out.py c13.out-sas sas-out
```

Then the ```py-out``` and ```sas-out``` files are compared using the
```taxcalc/validation/taxdiffs.tcl``` tool:

```
$ tclsh ../validation/taxdiffs.tcl py-out sas-out > c13-13.taxdiffs
```

The contents of ```c13-13.taxdiffs``` show that ...
