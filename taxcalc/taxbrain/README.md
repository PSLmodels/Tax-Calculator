Cross-Checking Reform Results from TaxBrain and Tax-Calculator
==============================================================

The contents of this taxcalc/taxbrain directory are for use by the
core development team only.  The purpose of the cross-checking is to
test that Tax-Calculator produces essentially the same reform results
when accessed in two different ways: (1) via the TaxBrain file-upload
web page <http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/> and (2) via the taxcalc
package running on a local computer.

The contents of this directory include JSON reform files used
in the cross-checking, which should be done immediately after each
TaxBrain upgrade to a new Tax-Calculator release.

See the comments in `r0.json` and `a1.json` for examples of how the
cross-checking is done.
