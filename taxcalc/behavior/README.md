Behavioral Responses Files
--------------------------

This directory contains an example of a behavioral responses file that can
be modified to construct your own behavioral responses files
that are stored on your local computer.

Such an behavioral responses file can then be used by the `tc`
command-line interface to Tax-Calculator with the `--behavior` option
or be read in a Python program that uses the Python API.

[This
document](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/behavior/BEHAVIOR.md)
provides access to a template behavioral responses file that assumes
no behavioral responses because all the elasticities are assumed to be
zero.
