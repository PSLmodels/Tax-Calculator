This directory contains examples of tax reform files that can be
combined and modified to construct your own tax reform proposals
stored in text files on your local computer.

Such reform proposals can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) for analysis, or be
analyzed on your local computer using the tc CLI (command-line
interface) to Tax-Calculator, as described in the [user
documentation](../../docs/index.html#cli).

[This document](REFORMS.md) provides access to several reform files
that represent recent tax reform proposals.
