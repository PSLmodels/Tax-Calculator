This directory contains examples of tax reform provisions that can be
combined and modified to construct tax reform proposals stored in text
files on your local computer.

Such reform proposals can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](http://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) (or used on your local
computer) to estimate reform effects.

[This document](REFORMS.md) provides access to the reform provisions
in a way that corresponds to how the policy parameters are organized
on the TaxBrain webapp.
