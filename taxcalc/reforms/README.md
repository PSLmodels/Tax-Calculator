Policy Reform Files
-------------------

This directory contains examples of policy reform files that can be
combined and modified to create your own policy reform files that
are stored on your local computer.

Such policy reform files can then be uploaded to the [TaxBrain
webapp](https://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/file/) for analysis or be
analyzed on your local computer by using the `tc` command-line
interface to Tax-Calculator as described in the [user
guide](https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/index.html#cli) or
by writing your own Python scripts that import the Tax-Calculator
`taxcalc` package as described in the
[cookbook](https://PSLmodels.github.io/Tax-Calculator/cookbook.html).

[This
document](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/reforms/REFORMS.md#how-to-specify-a-tax-reform-in-a-json-policy-reform-file)
provides access to several reform files that represent recent tax
reform proposals and guidelines about how to prepare your own reform
files.  Look in particular at the
[FAQ](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/reforms/TCJA.md#tcja-faq)
on TCJA-related reforms.
