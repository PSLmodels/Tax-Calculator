2015-16 CSV Input Variables Documentation
=========================================

First an alphabetical list of all input variables and then an
example of a small CSV-formatted input file.

All Input Variables
-------------------

The following table includes all the input variables contained in
CSV-formatted input files generated by the `csv_in.py` script and
used by Tax-Calculator.
These (arcane) variable names follow the variable naming convention
in the IRS-SOI Public Use File (PUF).
IRS Form line numbers marked with an asterisk must add up to the amount
entered for line number without an asterisk.
