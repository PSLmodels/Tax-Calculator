Structural overview
===================

Tax-Calculator has been designed using [object-oriented programming
(OOP)](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/object-oriented-programming)
principles.  There are seven classes and a collection of global
utility functions, but most Python programming involves using only a
few methods in three classes.

## Quick summary

Typical Tax-Calculator usage involves creating two Calculator class
objects: both containing the same sample of filing units (that is,
Records class object), but each containing a different tax policy
(that is, Policy class object).  The idea is to compare the calculated
tax liabilities of the sample units under the two different tax
policies, one of which is usually current-law policy and the other is
a tax reform of interest.

*   `rec` → Records class object.  
    Created by `Records.cps_constructor()` when containing CPS-derived
    filing-unit data.    

*   `clp` → `Policy` class object containing parameters that characterize
current-law policy.  
    Created by `Policy()`.

* `ref` → `Policy` class object containing parameters that
characterize a tax reform.
    Created using a Python dictionary `refdict` representing the reform by
    using the `implement_reform(refdict)` method on a `Policy` object created
    by `Policy()`.
    Or created using a JSON file `filename` representing the reform by using
    the `implement_reform(Policy.read_json_reform(filename))` method on a
    `Policy` object created by `Policy()`.

*   `calc_clp` → Calculator class object for current-law policy.  
    Created by `Calculator(records=rec, policy=clp)`.

*   `calc_ref` → Calculator class object for reform policy.  
    Created by `Calculator(records=rec, policy=ref)`.

*   `calc_all()` → Calculator class method that computes tax liability
(and many intermediate variables such as AGI) for each filing-unit.

*   `itax_clp` → Variable containing aggregate income tax liability under
current-law policy.  
    Created by `weighted_total('iitax')` method called on `calc_clp` object
    after `calc_all()` called.

*   `diff_table` → Pandas DataFrame object containing reform-minus-current-law
difference table for income tax liability by expanded-income deciles.  
    Created by
    `calc_clp.difference_table(calc_ref, 'weighted_deciles', 'iitax')` method
    called after `calc_all()` has been called on both Calculator objects.

{doc}`../recipes/index`.

## Complete story

Tax-Calculator contains eight basic classes, and a collection of
global utility functions, that together provide the full range of
Tax-Calculator capabilities.  Here is a description of their role in
Tax-Calculator and a link to each the detailed documentation and
source code for each class and all its methods.

### Classes

*   `Data` → Contains basic logic for manipulating cross-sectional data that
need to have growth factors and sample weights to age the data to years after
the data start year.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [data.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/data.py).

*   `Records` → Derived from `Data` and contains attributes of each tax filing
unit.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [records.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/records.py).

*   `GrowFactors` → Contains CBO-derived baseline annual growth factors that
are used to specify price inflation and wage growth rates in the `Policy` class
object and to specify annual growth factors that are applied to monetary
attributes of the filing units in the `Records` class object.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [growfactors.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/growfactors.py).

*   `Parameters` → Contains basic value extrapolation, revision, and validation
logic for time-varying parameters that can be any of four types and can be
either scalar-valued or vector-valued.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [parameters.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/parameters.py).

*   `Policy` → Derived from `Parameters` and contains tax policy parameters.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [policy.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/policy.py).

*   `GrowDiff` → Derived from `Parameters` and contains differences from
CBO-derived baseline growth factors in the `GrowFactors` class object.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [growdiff.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/growdiff.py).

*   `Consumption` → Derived from `Parameters` and contains parameters related
to consumption that are used in the `Calculator` class object.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [consumption.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/consumption.py).

*   `Calculator` → Contains a `Policy` class object, a `Records` class object,
and a `Consumption` class object, plus functions that contain the logic
required to calculate income and payroll tax liability for each filing unit.  
    Documentation and source code are in
    [calculator.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/calculator.py) and in
    [calcfunctions.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/calcfunctions.py).

### Utilities

Documentation and source code for the global utility functions are in
[utils.py](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/blob/master/taxcalc/utils.py).
